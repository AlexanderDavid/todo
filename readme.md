# What is This?
I have been searching for a nice way to store todos as plaintext on my machine. But then I realized it might be a nice side project. This is a simple command line todo list manager written in rust.

# Ideas for Future
- Different ways to print (Table, plain, etc.)
- Categories
- Sorting
	Sorting can occur on either the date or the priority, ascending or descending.
	d or da sorts the dates from lowest to highest top to bottom
	dd	sorts the dates from highest to lowest top to bottom
	p or pa sorts the priority from lowest to highset top to bottom
	pd 	sorts the priority from highest to lowest top to bottom
- Filtering
- Limiting printed todos
- Due dates ellapsed are first
- Examples
- Web/Phone app (far future)
